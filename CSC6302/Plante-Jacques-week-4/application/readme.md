# Jacques Plante CSC6302 Database Application

## Running instructions
To run the main app.js file, simply put
```
npm start
```
in the terminal

## DB Setup
In the SQL folder, run the files in the following order:
```
ddl.sql
users.sql
permissions.sql
procedure_functions.sql
dml.sql
```
This should start your database cleanly and add some baseline data to play with
