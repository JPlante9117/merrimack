# Jacques Plante CSC6302 Database Application

## Running instructions
To run the app, simply put
```
npm install && npm start
```
in the terminal

Then hit http://localhost:3000/students for your baseline.

## DB Setup
In the SQL folder, run the files in the following order:
```
ddl.sql
users.sql
permissions.sql
procedure_functions.sql
