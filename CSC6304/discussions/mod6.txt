From a development perspective, I'm more comfortable developing in web applications since that is what I've been doing for years. I have dabbled a little bit in mobile development using React Native which allowed me to apply a lot of what I know about web development to mobile development, but even still, I'm more comfortable in the web space.

From a user perspective, I almost always opt for the native app. I say almost as there are some web applications that I still prefer using, such as Google Drive. But, I find that the dedicated app experience is typically where companies tend to send their money and focus for future development and improvements, so I try to keep up with those. I will say that most of the time, I am using free applications. Rarely do I actually spend money on apps, especially if they are monthly subscriptions. I always keep tabs on the web app versions of these, however, in case a bad update comes through that I cannot roll back easily, or I am otherwise experiencing issues with the native app.

An example that comes to mind that I occasionally go back to the web application for is Discord. It's very rare that I have issues using my desktop/mobile app for it, but in the cases that I do, I know I can just use their website to connect.
